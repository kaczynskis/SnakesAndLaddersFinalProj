##**Week 1 & 2:**##

*-We decided to do our project on replicating a Snakes and Ladders game by using client and server classes as well as a GUI. 
*-This week, we set up a repository and figured out how to import our repository into Eclipse.
*-We came across a great issue when trying to import our repository into Eclipse. It took us a while to have it all sorted out.

##**Week 3:**##

*-Last week, we were finally able to see our project in Eclipse.
*-This week, we created classes for the client and server and started to write the code for it.
*-The greatest challenge that we are encountering is translating the previously provided Python code for the client and server class to Java. 

##**Week 4:**##

*-Last week, we made the classes for the client and server.
*-During this week, we set up the BoardPair, Gameboard, and Gridbox classes and are nearly finished with them.
*-A challenge that we faced this week was conceptualizing the gameplay and figuring out how all of the classes will work together. 

##**Week 5:**##

*-Last week, we made the BoardPair, Gameboard, and Gridbox classes.
*-This week, we finished the Gameboard, BoardPair, DiceRoller, and Server class. We also began to work on the multi-threading that is required for our game to work. 
*-The challenge we encountered this week was trying to understand how multi-threading works, as we both do not have any real experience implementing it in the past.

##**Week 6:**##

*-Last week, we finished the majority of our classes and started multi-threading.
*-This week, we converted our Java code to Python and removed some classes. 
*-We encountered our greatest challenge of the entire project this week. We realized we wouldn't be able to have a fully deliverable program by the deadline using Java so, we decided to go ahead and recreate our game entirely in Python. It worked very well and we were able to get the code running decently by the time of the demo in our presentation. Our biggest regret is not switching to Python much earlier in the project.
