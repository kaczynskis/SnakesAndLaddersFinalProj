Week 1 & 2:

-We decided to do our project on replicating a Snakes and Ladders game by using client and server classes as well as a GUI. 
-This week, we set up a repository and figured out how to import our repository into Eclipse.
-We came across a great issue when trying to import our repository into Eclipse. It took us a while to have it all sorted out.

Week 3:

-Last week, we were finally able to see our project in Eclipse.
-This week, we created classes for the client and server and started to write the code for it.
-The greatest challenge that we are encountering is translating the previously provided Python code for the client and server class to Java.
